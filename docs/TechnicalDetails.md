# Technical details

## Overview

The gamepak uses a flash 128K memory chip to back the game up, but the actual savegame is only 8560 (0x2170) bytes long.
Moreover, when the game starts, it will copy the savegame's data to the on-board work RAM at 0x02011C20.
The following events cause the savegame to be written back to the gamepak's flash memory:

*   A duel/match ends (in case of a victory, this happens after the player has received a booster pack and left the screen where the pack's content is displayed)
*   The player leaves the deck editor
*   A successful card trade
*   A password has been successfully used to receive a card

## Savegame layout

For convenience, the following table lists offsets relative to the start of the savegame (first column) and the absolute address to their counterpart in the on-board work RAM (second column).

**Notes:**

*   Offsets and addresses are expressed in hexadecimal notation
*   Sizes are expressed in bytes
*   Integer values are stored in Little Endian byte order
